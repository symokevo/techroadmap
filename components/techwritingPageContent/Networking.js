              Bootcamps are created to help one with little to no experience in
              coding gain programming skills by offering them technical training
              on the relevant skills. They focus on the most important aspects
              of coding while allowing one to apply these new skills to solve
              real-life problems. They are like schools and some of them offer
              Certificates/Diplomas upon completion. Most of them are not free.
              Below are a few of the most popular bootcamps:

              Internships are a period of work often taken to gain professional
              learning experience relating to a field of study or career
              interest. You also get to be mentored by seniors and experts in
              your field from different parts of the world, sometimes even
              working on real-life projects. It can be paid or unpaid, meaning
              some of them pay you for partaking and successfully completing the
              program. You can find below, a list of organizations that offer
              coding internships and mentoring in the technical writing field.
